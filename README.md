# Tournament Stream Tool
This is a [Tournament Stream Helper](https://github.com/joaorb64/TournamentStreamHelper) like tool that I am developing in hopes of learning more about desktop application development, along with potentially using this in a real tournament setting.
I would highly recommend using Tournament Stream Helper instead of this, as it is more feature complete and has much greater support.
If you would still like to use this tool, you can download it from [the releases page](https://github.com/aryan-sinhala349/tournament-stream-tool/releases).
I would not try to recommend building it from source, as I can only provide limited support.
